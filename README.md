- **Lightweight and Efficient:** HamEngine is designed to be lightweight and optimized, ensuring smooth performance even on low-end hardware.
- **Easy to Use:** With a clean and intuitive API, HamEngine makes it easy to get started with game development, even for beginners.
- **Modular Architecture:** The engine is built with a modular architecture, allowing you to extend and customize its functionality to suit your specific needs.
- **Audio and Input Support:** HamEngine provides support for audio playback and input handling, allowing you to create immersive and interactive experiences.
- **Asset Management:** Easily manage and load game assets such as textures, models, sounds, and more.
- **2D and 3D Rendering:** Render 2D sprites or dive into 3D game development with built-in support for models, lighting, and shaders.
- **Physics Simulation:** Implement realistic physics behavior in your games using the integrated physics engine.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with HamEngine:

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:
   - C++ compiler compatible with C++17 standard
   - OpenGL development libraries
   - [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org) library
   - [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net) library

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the HamEngine repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/hamyyy/HamEngine.git
```


3. **Build the Engine:** Navigate to the cloned repository and build the engine:

```
cd HamEngine
make
```


4. **Run the Sample Game:** After the build process is complete, you can run the sample game included with the engine:

```
./hamengine samples/sample_game
```


This will launch the sample game using the HamEngine framework.

5. **Start Developing Your Game:** Now that you have successfully run the sample game, you can start building your own game using HamEngine. Explore the codebase, modify the sample game, or create a new project from scratch.
